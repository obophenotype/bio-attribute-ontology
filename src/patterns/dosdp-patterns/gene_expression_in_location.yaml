description: 'Use this pattern to annotate gene expression in location traits
  where the quality of the process of the expression of a gene, gene complex or
  gene family is observed or measured, but no judgement is made whether the
  quality deviates or not from a reference. In contrast to gene expression
  related phenotypes, the gene expression trait is indifferent about the
  quality of the process being normal or abnormal. You should specify the
  genetically most relevant participant or participant category for this trait
  pattern, i.e. the gene(s) being expressed or the products of those genes, and
  not any other participant (e.g. ribosomes or ribonucleotides) in the gene
  expression process. The location must be an anatomical entity.'
