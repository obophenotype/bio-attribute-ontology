description: 'Use this pattern to annotate gene expression traits where the
  quality of the process of the expression of a gene, gene complex or gene
  family is observed or measured, but no judgement is made whether the quality
  deviates or not from a reference. In contrast to gene expression related
  phenotypes, the gene expression trait is indifferent about the quality of the
  process being normal or abnormal. You should specify the genetically most
  relevant participant or participant category for this trait pattern, i.e. the
  gene(s) being expressed or the products of those genes, and not any other
  participant (e.g. ribosomes or ribonucleotides) in the gene expression
  process.'
